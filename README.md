# sip_optimal_control

Provides a simple and convenient interface for running SIP on dense optimal control problems.
Equips SIP with a regularized LQR Newton-KKT system solver and explores the stagewise block
nature of the problem.

Note that this repository is under active development. Until an example has been added
to the [SIP Examples](https://github.com/joaospinto/sip_examples) repository or this note
has been removed, consider the code here to not be production-ready.
